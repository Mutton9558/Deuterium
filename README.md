# Tools Used
1. Languages: HTML, Python
2. Libraries/Frameworks: Flask, yt-dlp

# Current Issues
1. YouTube bot authentication prevents the site from accessing YouTube videos
2. Inefficient conversion system that relies on the server to download the video first before allowing users to download.

# Solution
Scrap the idea of web application and instead use the website to publish a desktop application for said functionality
